GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU GPL gives you certain additional freedoms.  For example, it
refers to software products as "licensed products", and it says that
you have the right to distribute copies of the product to others, and
to ask recipients to place the same freedoms on the products they
distribute.  The GPL requires that distributed works remain free works,
so they can be modified and distributed by anyone who wants to change
the works.

Application

The GNU GPL applies to the operation of a program as installed for
general, public, product use.  It does not apply to works made for
users' private, non-public use, or to their operation as works made
for or on a user's behalf.  The GPL permits such works to remain
private, or be issued under another license.  We use this variable
permission for works, commercial products, and distributions of works,
in order to accomplish our goal of maximum distribution of free
software, in order to promote the public good.

The GNU GPL was carefully designed to be as easy to understand, and as
flexible and powerful, as possible.

The GNU GPL has been used by many large and small software companies
to produce billions of dollars of software.  This license is important
because it provides the original copyright holders the
assurance that their future changes will still result in a work
published under the GNU GPL, without any additional terms or
conditions.

But it is also important because the GNU GPL gives permission to
distribute software copied from its original to the public for free.
This means that the work is in the public domain where the original
copyright holder has no copyright in it.

It also means that you can make sure that your changes, if you make
any, will still come under the GNU GPL, so that they, too, will be
free software.

Sponsorship

of the GNU Project is by the Free Software Foundation.  These sponsors
